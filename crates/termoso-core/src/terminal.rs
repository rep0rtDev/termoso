//! Protocol-agnostic interactive terminal session.
//!
//! The UI (xterm.js) only needs three things from a terminal: a stream of
//! output bytes, a way to write input bytes and a way to report size changes.
//! SSH shells, local PTYs and Telnet all implement [`TerminalSession`] so the
//! desktop tab code does not care which one it is talking to.
