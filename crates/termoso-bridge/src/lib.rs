//! Termoso API Bridge.
//!
//! A headless client you run in your own infrastructure. It exposes a small
//! REST API (compatible in spirit with the Termius API Bridge) that scripts,
//! CMDBs and autoscalers call with *plaintext* hosts, groups and credentials.
//! The bridge encrypts every entity locally with the vault keys the cabinet
//! sealed to it and pushes the ciphertext through the normal sync protocol,
//! so the Termoso server keeps storing opaque blobs only.
//!
//! ```text
//!   your automation ── plaintext ──▶ termoso-bridge ── ciphertext ──▶ termoso-server
//!                                    (your network)                  (opaque sync)
//! ```
