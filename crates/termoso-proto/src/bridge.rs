//! API Bridge: a headless client the user runs in their own infrastructure
//! (Docker) to create and delete hosts, groups and credentials from scripts.
//!
//! The bridge holds its own key pair; the cabinet seals the vault keys it may
//! use to that key. Everything the bridge writes is encrypted locally and
//! travels through the normal sync protocol, so the server keeps seeing
//! opaque blobs only. Its bearer token is a restricted session: sync plus
//! `GET /bridge/me`, nothing else.
